## Entry Points for Contributors

**Start anywhere. Fork freely. No permission needed.**

### Story Entry Points

- Write a chapter where Lykos encounters a minor god of a forgotten freshwater spring, who offers a cryptic piece of the puzzle in exchange for a story Lykos must 'drown' in the spring.
- Draft a scene from the perspective of Theron, years earlier, witnessing his own mythic encounter that hardened him against 'dreaming'.
- Create a 'mythic interlude'—a short, parable-like story told by a character Lykos meets, that reflects the novel's themes of seeking and transformation.
- Write a letter Lykos composes but never sends, to his mother or to the ghost of his father, at a key moment of despair or revelation on his journey.

### Technical Entry Points

- Build an interactive map of Lykos's journey, where geographic locations are overlayed with their associated myths, symbols, and Lykos's internal state at each point.
- Create a 'Kairos Engine'—a simple text generator or interactive fiction snippet that presents the user with sensory details (wind, light, sound) and asks them to intuit the 'right moment' for a pivotal action, reflecting Lykos's developing skill.
